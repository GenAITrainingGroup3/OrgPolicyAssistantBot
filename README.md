# AI-powered Organizational Policy Assistant Bot


# 1. Problem Statement:
Employees often have questions regarding organizational policies, such as leave entitlements, expense procedures, and remote work guidelines. The problem we aim to solve is to provide instant, accurate answers to these policy-related questions without the need for manual intervention by HR staff. The goal is to create an AI-powered Organizational Policy Assistant Bot that leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to refer to internal policy documents and provide employees with the information they need.
